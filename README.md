# Pig-Dice program

This program is designed to simulate a real dice

## Getting Started
*A working browser(Chrome Version 68.0.3440.106 (Official Build) (64-bit))
*A working internet connection.


## Behavior Driven Development.
The New game button returns all values to zero so that a new session can begin.
The game is such that when the Roll dice button is pressed, values gotten higher than one will be displayed on the player's scoresheet,
If the player holds,the last value before holding will be stored permanently to tally up to his or her total score.
subsequently holding forfeits the bonus roll of the dice.
If a player rolls and gets a 1, 0 will be displayed on their scoresheet and they would have to pass on the turn to the next player.
